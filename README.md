# dupeguru-post-processor

`dupeguru-post-processor` is a Python script that can be used to compare a folder on your computer to a set of dupeGuru results. Specifically, it can be used to determine which files in the folder are not listed in the CSV file; effectively, identifying the files of which dupeGuru found _no_ duplicates.

[dupeGuru](https://github.com/arsenetar/dupeguru) is a tool that can be used to identify duplicate files among two or more folders. The creation of this "post-processing" script was inspired by [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/arsenetar/dupeguru/issues/218).

# Workflow

```mermaid
  flowchart LR
  
    subgraph d [dupeGuru]
      d1[Perform scan]-->d2[Export results as CSV file]
    end
    
    subgraph p [post-processor]
      p1[Specify folder]-->p2[Specify CSV file]
      p2-->p3[Specify output file path (optionally)]
      p3-->p4[Run this script]
      p4-->p5[See list of files]
    end
  
    d2-.->p1
```

This script was developed using Python version 3.10.
